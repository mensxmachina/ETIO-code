Code for the paper "Borboudakis, G. and Tsamardinos, I., 2016, August. Towards robust and versatile causal discovery for business applications. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 1435-1444). ACM."

Contains an answer set programming implementation of the rules of ETIO (ETIO.lp), which can handle latent variables, selection bias (see the paper for more details), hard manipulations, multiple datasets with overlapping variable sets, as well as certain types of structural prior knowledge. It also contains a lua script (ETIO-lua-incremental.lp) that takes as input a file containing constraints and solves them incrementally as described in the paper. Finally, it contains a few MATLAB wrappers that run ETIO for a single observational dataset. Currently, there is no support to run ETIO from MATLAB using other settings.
